# 1st place at the CGDV Data Visualization Challenge!
Luis Ahumada and I created [this page](https://luisahumada.github.io/ChallengeCGDV/) for the challenge. We had to visualize at least one of the tables included in the [Drinking Water Quality in Ethiopia report](https://cgdv.github.io/challenges/Drinking-Water-Quality-in-Ethiopia/report/Drinking-water-quality-ethiopia-ESS-2016.pdf) by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia. Submissions were judged on: 1) Clarity of visual story, 2) Provision of causality and explanation, 3) Logical and rigorous data analysis, and 4) Creativity of data visualization.
